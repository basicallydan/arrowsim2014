## What is 'Arrow Simulator 2014'

It's a game concept. An RTS of sorts, where wars are won by attrition and strategy, not by crazy micromanagement. 

The broad vision is armies and supply lines represented on a global scale on a world map by 'tactical arrows' (think dad's army opening). Battle lines are drawn with arrows impacting each other and armies are pushed back in wars of attrition rather than bulldozed by the best min-maxer. Supply lines and reinforcements are the key to long drawn out engagements.
